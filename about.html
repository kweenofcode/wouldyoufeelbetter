      <p class="paragraph">I try to make it look casual as I flip through the Value Village dress rack, but I keep my music low and take mental notes of the shoppers closest to me. Most leave me alone. One passing woman laughs as I measure a red tunic-style dress against my body, and tells me how “cute” she bets I would look in it. I laugh along, even thanking her. I make sure to speak loudly enough for anyone listening to hear. I’m safer if people assume I’m buying this dress as a joke. When it happens, I’m considering the length of a blue and white cocktail dress, so I don’t hear the elderly woman still feeling for the quality of a nightgown by rubbing it between her thumb and index finger being accosted by the mean-looking woman who bustles past me on her way out the door. I only turned in their direction because of how loudly the third, kind-looking woman, had gasped and clicked her tongue. I try to read the situation to decide if it's my place to ask the elderly woman if she’s alright. I start by surveying the scene with a general, sympathetic gaze, but soon I am staring directly into the narrowed eyes of the elderly woman who looks at me with disgust. I know that later, when she tells this story to whoever it is in her life she tells these stories to, she will misgender me as the "man" too busy browsing dresses to help. Panicked, I say, "I'm sorry you just got accosted by a stranger in a Value Village. I'm not buying this dress as a joke. I'm buying it because I'm nonbinary".</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The dress was for a presentation I’d eventually give about this project to my classmates and instructors. It's my third for the full-time front end web development bootcamp I’m enrolled in at HackerYou. It was only days before I’d started the program that I’d started to go exclusively by Ky and adopted a nonbinary identity. It felt ridiculous, at 29 years old, to finally contend with my gender identity. Each of the 29 questions in this project is one I’ve struggled with over the last 29 years.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The first 14 questions represent the years before I knew I was queer. Each is a yes or no answer about what a nonbinary body. At question 15, things get muddier and there's an option for “other”. I was part-way through this project the first time I listed my gender as “other” on a form, and it brought up a lot of complicated feelings so I added in a functionality that allows the user to redefine "other".</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The first time I admitted to anyone that I was nonbinary was the afternoon I asked Google, “how do I know if I’m nonbinary?”. Google had no helpful answers. That night I drunkenly asked a friend if they’d ever questioned their gender identity, then quickly admitted that I was asking when what I really wanted to do was tell them. So, I told them how I’d never been male, neither had I ever been female. I told them I didn’t believe body like mine belonged anywhere in between. As always, they were kind and supportive. The next morning, for the first time in my life, I looked at my body in the mirror and didn’t dissect it into male parts and female parts. Instead I appreciated it for what it was. For 29 years I had resented my body for being too male in places, and too female in others. I had spent 29 years thinking that questioning my gender identity meant hating my body, when actually adopting a nonbinary identity has helped me learn how to actually love my body.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">With this project, I don't want to claim that my experience is typical of all nonbinary people or discredit anyone's relationship to their body or their gender identity. This project is deeply personal and very specific to the questions I've asked myself as I've come to understand my body as a nonbinary person.</p>
      <h3 class="header-3"> <span class="hl hl--small">02. </span> How It Works</h3>
      <p class="paragraph">The whole project is built using a combination of vanilla JavaScript and jQuery (a JavaScript library). There are 32 sections that I’ve called “cards” in total. There are 29 cards, one for each of the questions, 1 for the intro page, 1 for the results page, and 1 that allows the user to change the value of “other”. When the user loads the project, the introductory question is the only thing positioned on the page. The 29 questions are all positioned in a way that stacks them just to the right of the window.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">At first, The first 14 cards are blank except for the illustration, the background, and the ‘yes’ or ‘no’ options. Each of the traits asked about on the first 14 cards is stored in a JavaScript object that categorizes them as ‘Hair’, ‘Piercing’, ‘Presentation’, or ‘Physical Traits’. Once the page has loaded a function loops through this object and places each of these traits into a sentence that reads “Do they have _____?”. Each of these sentences is then placed onto the first 14 cards.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Once this has been done, I used the Fisher Yates method to shuffle the numbers 1 through 14 (all contained within an array). Once they’ve been shuffled each of the cards containing one of the first 14 questions is assigned one of these shuffled numbers as a page number and also as a corresponding class name. So if the first card is assigned page number 12, it would also be assigned the class of “question12”.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">Now that this is set up a user can begin answering the questions. I created a counter to ensure the user sees the shuffled questions in numerical order. At the beginning the counter is set to 0, and every time the user clicks on either “yes” or “no” the the current card is moved onto the screen, the current card is moved back off the screen, and the counter increases by one. If the user is currently question 10, the card they’re seeing will have a class of “question10” and the counter value will be 10. Once the user clicks either yes or no, that card moves off the screen, the value of the counter increases to 11, and the card with a class of “question11” is brought onto the screen.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The order of the final 15 questions was important to me, so I stored all the questions in an array that populates each of the remaining cards once the page has finished loading. (Storing them in an array makes it a bit easier for me to edit them, and also switch around their order should I need to). With these questions I also introduce the “other” option. The first time a user selects “other”an HTML form that has been stacked to the left of the screen is brought on. The form requires a user to define “other” for themselves in 20 characters or less. Once they click the “Choose Your Words” button, a function runs that replaces the word “other” on the remaining pages with whatever words the user typed in. Once this has been done once, the form is set to disappear so that it won't keep appearing every time the user selects the new "Other" value.</p>
      <p class="paragraph">The final step is to populate the results page with the percentage of times a user answered positively to a question. This is accomplished by setting up a function so that each time a user answers a question their answer is stored until the last question. This got tricky when I got to the ordered questions where I couldn’t account for what a user might mean when they answer “other". I decided that “other” would be catalogued as a positive answer. Once the user answers the final question, a function runs that tallies the number of positive answers (in this case, either "yes" or "other"), divides that total by the number of questions and multiplies the answer by 100 to get a percentage. I used a method from the JavaScript Math library to make sure this percentage was always rounded up to a whole integer. At this point the results get added to the final message and populate the last screen.</p>
